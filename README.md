# movie-recommendation-system
A basic movie recommendation system developed with Python and pandas, focusing on providing movie suggestions based on similarity to a selected movie. This is a foundational implementation of recommender systems, useful for those interested in exploring how similar items can be recommended based on shared features.

# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System! This project utilizes Python and pandas to create a basic movie recommendation system. It suggests movies that are most similar to a chosen movie, based on features like genre, actors, and user ratings. This project serves as a foundational example of recommendation systems, focusing on similarity-based item recommendations.

## Project Overview

In this project, we implemented a simple recommendation system that provides suggestions based on item similarity. Although not a comprehensive recommendation engine, this system is an excellent introduction to recommender algorithms and data manipulation techniques in Python.

## Key Features

- **Similarity-based Recommendations**: Recommends movies similar to a selected movie.
- **Data Analysis**: Leverages pandas for data processing and manipulation.
- **Basic Recommender Foundation**: Serves as a baseline for understanding recommendation system concepts.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GovindaTak/movie-recommendation-system.git
   cd movie-recommendation-system
